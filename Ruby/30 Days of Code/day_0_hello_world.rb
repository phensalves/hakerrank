# Objective 
# In this challenge, we review some basic concepts that will get you started with this series. Check out the Tutorial tab for learning materials and an instructional video!

# Task 
# To complete this challenge, you must save a line of input from stdin to a variable, print 𝙷𝚎𝚕𝚕𝚘, 𝚆𝚘𝚛𝚕𝚍.
# Hello, World.
#  on a single line, and finally print the value of your variable on a second line.

# You've got this!
